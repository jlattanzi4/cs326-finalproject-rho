Innovative Idea:
	Unlike traditional calorie trackers, we are going to create a web application to track calories specifically for people looking to gain lean muscle mass. Similar to apps such as myFitnessPal (UA), we will be creating a calorie tracker. Yet, myFitnessPal is aimed towards people trying to lose weight, while we will be creating an application for people aiming to gain more muscle mass. On top of this, we aim to create an aesthetically pleasing interface, whereas many other calorie trackers are bare-bones and not easy to work with.

Important Components:
	The main component of our final project is a calorie tracker. Users will enter the food they eat into our web application, specifying the food name, calories per serving, number of servings, as well as the macronutrients contained in the food itself. There will be sections to enter the food; breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, etc. There will also be a section for workouts, where users can simply put their workout and how many calories were burned, which will factor into their overall calories for the day.
	Another functionality that our project will have is that users will be able to specify how much weight they are looking to gain, and over what period of time. We will implement an equation to then find how many calories per day that specific user needs to eat in order to attain their goal. This can be tracked through the “weight” section, where users can enter their current weight and track their progress as they move along.
