Innovative Idea:
	We are going to create a web application where musical artists can post their work publicly. Unlike traditional music applications, this site will be specifically to hear from other people what they think about the song. Apps such as Apple Music, Spotify, and SoundCloud only offer a five-stars rating to rate the song. Our website will differ because it allows the artist to get their songs out there while maintaining more meaningful feedback from the people that are listening to the song. While it will have similarities to other music applications, our app will be mainly focused on direct song critique to artists instead of promotion.
	

Important Components:
	There will be two types of users that will be classified, artists and consumers. When an artist posts their work, both artists and consumers will be able to listen, rate, and comment on the post. The rating scale will be on a scale of 1-10, and the artist will be able to see how many people rated it, and what the average rating is. On top of this, users will be able to leave critiques on the artist’s work, things that the artist can work on in the future and hopefully better before their next post!
	Artists will each have their own profile, housing all of their posts, as well as a cumulative average of their ratings. Profiles will almost act as albums or portfolios, where if a consumer likes the artist’s work, they can go to their page and check out the rest of their work. Users will be able to make comments specific to a point in a song, helping the artists further. Audio files will be links to Youtube, meaning the artist will have to have it posted there and then link it in. The site will also contain categories for song and artist types.
